# BigInt Library

## Overview

The `BigInt` library is a C++ implementation for handling large integers beyond the standard data types. This library supports various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation and many more operators only limited for `Positive Numbers`.

## Features

- **Large Integer Support:** Handle integers larger than standard types (like `int` or `long long`).
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.
- **Comparison Operators:** Includes support for comparing two `BigInt` objects.
- **Input/Output:** Overloaded operators to easily read from input streams and output to the console.

## Files

This library consists of two main files:

1. **`BigInt.h`:** Header file containing all the prototypes and definitions of the member functions and constructors.
2. **`main.cpp`:** The main file that includes the `BigInt.h` header and contains code to demonstrate the usage of the `BigInt` library.

## Installation and Usage

**Compile the Code:**
  1. Navigate to the directory/folder containing the files.
  2. Run `main.cpp`, must include header `"BigInt.h"` in the program
